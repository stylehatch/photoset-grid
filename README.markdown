# photosetGrid

A simple jQuery plugin to arrange images into a flexible grid, based on Tumblr's photoset feature.

Originally the photosetGrid was designed for and used in our [Style Hatch](http://stylehatch.co) premium Tumblr themes, but now the plugin has been expanded for use on any site outside of Tumblr.

##### *All of the basic functionality is in place, but the refinements and documentation on how to use it for your site or Tumblr theme are in the works*
